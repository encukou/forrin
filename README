Forrin localization helpers


The goal of this project is to, eventually, provide i18n/L10n support for
Python programs, complete with automatic conjguation, declension,
and other word-morphing shenanigans in messages -- preferably for all languages
in the world.

The Translator class wraps gettext's C-like API as one callable object,
to be subclassed and instantiated in every module, and usually aliased to _.

Extraction methods are provided to detects calls to the _ function and store
them in a POT file; the extractors will also play nicely with Babel's setuptools
hooks if you should choose to go in that direction.

When a traslated message begins with the "@" symbol, it becomes a Template,
a unicode subclass which can do language-specific magic in its format() method.

Forrin uses UTF-8 exclusively.
